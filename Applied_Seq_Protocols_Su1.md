BIOL3411 Sec 01 (CRN 41308): Applied Sequence Analysis Protocols, Summer 1 2025

Introduces students to concepts and skills needed to productively “interrogate” genomic data and move toward participating in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. Students gain hands-on experience applying common computational techniques to actual sequence datasets generated by research labs in the Biology Department. Skills covered include navigating a command-line environment, submitting jobs on a high-capacity computing cluster, and using basic R packages to analyze and visualize genomic data. Students will also learn good data practices while building a portfolio of their work on GitHub. While knowledge of coding is not a prerequisite, a fearless attitude toward computers is an asset.

Syllabus will be posted here in mid-April.
